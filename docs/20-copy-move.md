# Copy/Move Folders and Records to Another Safe or Folder

There are two ways to move records from one folder/safe to another: Copy/Move and Drag-and-Drop. To move folders, use Drag-and-Drop method.

## Drag and Drop

To move any password, file, note, bank card record, and folders use the standard procedure: "grab" the record and "drag" it to the destination folder. That's it.

:::note DnD limitations

- You can only move records this way. To copy records, use the Copy/Paste method below.
- Drag and Drop is not available on mobile devices. Again, Copy/Paste works.

## Copy and Paste

Click on the record title to open its dialog and select **Move** or **Copy** icon

Now open the menu of the destination safe or folder. The Paste command becomes active. Select Paste and the entry will be copied or moved to a new location.

Please note, that the Paste command is only active for 30 seconds after you click the Move or Copy.
